Batch soon-to-be-daemon.

Expects jobs to be located in JOBDIR, output will be put in OUTDIR.
Jobs in JOBDIR will be run in order of ctime; older jobs first.

Jobs are tar files, optionally compressed. Output archives will have
the same name as input file -- including extensions -- but always
gzip compressed.

Input files should have an executable file named `run` in the root.
Input can be supplied in the file `STDIN`. The output of `run` will
be redirected to `STDOUT` and `STDERR`.

## TODO/wishlist

* Jobs should be run as the same user who owns the job archive. Output
  should have the same owner.
* inotify should be used to keep track of job directory changes.
* Output file count always shows 1.
